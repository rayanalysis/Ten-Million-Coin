# project details
# a time-bound distributed currency
# that replaces chain exponential energy usage
# with a finite energy distributed ledger
# made up of a randomly generated set of values
# in a range of natural numbers

# conceptually, energy is conserved by awarding the
# winning guess the Nth "coin" in a stepwise registry
# of the vector of secret randomly generated values
# with the Unix Time as a standard of linear computation

# given a finite cycle time to guess the registry value,
# the winning computer is the first one which guesses 
# correctly in a normalized time range across wallets
